        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the demo project <strong>Videoflix</strong>, a non-commercial, experimental
            software developed for educational and demonstration purposes. The platform allows user registration and
            login, but data is only processed for testing purposes and is not used in a live environment.</p>

        <h2>1. General Information</h2>
        <p>Videoflix is a demo platform designed for educational and testing purposes. It allows users to create
            accounts, log in, and interact with the platform in a simulated environment. However, no real services or
            content are provided, and no personal data is shared with third parties.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>When you register on the Videoflix platform, we collect basic information, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Username</li>
            <li>Email address</li>
            <li>Password (stored in a securely hashed format)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information is used solely for the purpose of allowing users to log in and interact with the demo
            environment. No additional data is collected unless explicitly stated during testing.</p>

        <h2>3. Purpose of Data Collection</h2>
        <p>The data collected during registration and login is used to provide access to the platformâ€™s demo features.
            This includes managing user sessions, storing user preferences, and ensuring a smooth user experience. Since
            this project is for demonstration purposes, the data is not used for marketing, profiling, or other
            commercial purposes.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>Your personal data is stored in a local database for the duration of the demo project. All passwords are
            securely hashed, and appropriate technical measures are in place to protect the data from unauthorized
            access. However, since this is a non-commercial project, no live security monitoring or advanced data
            protection systems are in place.</p>

        <h2>5. Use of Cookies</h2>
        <p>Videoflix may use local cookies or session data to maintain user sessions and preferences during testing.
            These cookies are not used for tracking purposes and are only stored locally for the duration of your
            session.</p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Videoflix does not integrate with any third-party services, such as analytics, advertising, or social media
            platforms. All data processing is done within the demo environment, and no personal information is shared
            with external providers.</p>

        <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Since this is a demo project, any user data collected during testing will be retained only for the duration
            of the project and may be deleted at any time. As this is not a live service, there is no long-term data
            retention policy.</p>

        <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>As a user of the Videoflix demo platform, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The right to access your data</li>
            <li>The right to request correction or deletion of your data</li>
            <li>The right to withdraw your consent at any time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact the developer using the information provided below.</p>

        <h2>9. Contact Information</h2>
